title: Migrating from TestEZ
---

If you are using [TestEZ](https://github.com/Roblox/testez), migrating to Jest Lua v2.4.x should be fairly straightforward. Many parts of Jest Lua v2.x still use the TestEZ API.

To migrate to Jest Lua v3.x, additionally see [upgrading to Jest Lua v3](upgrading-to-jest3).

:::warning
The community Jest Lua fork has not published `v2.x`. Migrating straight from TestEZ to Jest Lua `v3.x` requires following this guide and then [upgrading to Jest Lua v3](upgrading-to-jest3).
:::

Replace `TestEZ` with `JestGlobals` in your `Wally.toml`.

```diff title="wally.toml"
[dev-dependencies]
- TestEZ = "roblox/testez@0.4.1"
+ JestGlobals = "jsdotlua/jest-globals@3.10.0"
```

Unlike TestEZ, which is injected into the global environment, you will need to explicitly require anything you need from `JestGlobals`. For example, to use the new Jest Lua assertion library, add this to the top of your test file.

```lua
local JestGlobals = require("@DevPackages/JestGlobals")
local expect = JestGlobals.expect
```

:::info
Globals that are injected make life very difficult for languages with strong types — because there's no specific import, and the code artifact injecting the globals can change underneath hard-coded type signatures, it requires inefficient tooling and workarounds.

Additionally, upstream Jest also plans to remove injected globals and instead prefers that users import any needed functionality through the `@jest/globals` package.

Jest Lua is staying ahead of that plan and not including support for injected globals. In Jest Lua v3.x, _every_ import will need to be explicitly required, including `describe`, `it`, etc. See [Globals](api) for a list of all exports.

If you were previously overwriting the Luau type for `expect` as a workaround for TestEZ custom expectations, you can remove it.
```diff
-local expect: any = expect
```

Then, replace the TestEZ `expect` syntax with their equivalents in Jest Lua. The equivalent matchers for each TestEZ matcher are listed below.

The new Jest Lua matchers are much more powerful than their TestEZ equivalents so see the [reference doc](expect) for more advanced usage, and also see all the new matchers Jest Lua has to offer.

### `.to.equal(value)`

`.to.equal(value)` method does a strict equality check, which exists in Jest Lua as `.toBe(value)`.
```diff
- expect(1).to.equal(1)
+ expect(1).toBe(1)
```

This is different from the `.toEqual` matcher in Jest Lua, which does a recursive deep equality check. For example:
```lua
expect({a = 1}).to.equal({a = 1}) -- fails in TestEZ
expect({a = 1}).toBe({a = 1})     -- fails in Jest Lua, but warns you
expect({a = 1}).toEqual({a = 1})  -- passes in Jest Lua
```

### `.to.be.ok()`

`.to.be.ok()` is a `nil` check, which is `.never.toBeNil()` in Jest Lua.
```diff
- expect(1).to.be.ok()
+ expect(1).never.toBeNil()
```

### `.to.be.near(value)`
`.to.be.near(value)` is used to compare floating point numbers for approximate equality. In Jest Lua, it is `.toBeCloseTo(number, numDigits?)`.
```diff
- expect(0.1 + 0.2).to.be.near(0.3)
+ expect(0.1 + 0.2).toBeCloseTo(0.3)
```

### `.to.be.a(type)`
`.to.be.a(type)` is used to do type checking. Type checking in Jest Lua is done using the `.toEqual()` matcher with `expect.any(type)`.
```diff
- expect(1).to.be.a("number")
+ expect(1).toEqual(expect.any("number"))
```

`expect.any()` is an asymmetric matcher, which can be used for much more than just checking primitive types like this. See the reference doc on [`expect.any()`](expect#expectanytypename--prototype).

### `.to.throw()`
`.to.throw()` can be replaced with `.toThrow()`
```diff
expect(function()
	error("nope")
- end).to.throw()
+ end).toThrow("nope")
```

A `.toThrow()` with no arguments will match against any exception, so it is recommended to match against a specific error message or use the [`Error`](expect#error) polyfill to throw and match against a specific exception. See the reference doc on [`.toThrow(error?)`](expect#tothrowerror).

### `.extend(matchers)`
`expect.extend` takes `self` (or `_` if the `matcherContext` isn't needed) as its first argument and the `message` property in the return value must be a function. See the reference doc on the [custom matcher API](expect#custom-matchers-api).
```diff
expect.extends({
-	customMatcher = function(arg)
+	customMatcher = function(_, arg)
		return {
			pass = true,
-			message = "message",
+			message = function() return "message" end
		}
	end
})
```
